From November 03 to 14, I attended the [Devoxx BE](https://www.devoxx.be) and the [Devoxx Morocco](https://www.devoxx.ma) conferences.

During these software developer events, I gave a Tool-in-Action talks about [Machine Learning on IoT and Tensorflow Lite](https://devoxx.be/talk/?id=37401) and a lightening talk introducing [5G](https://devoxx.be/wednesday-schedule/talk?id=38051).

You can watch the recording of both talk on [Devoxx YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg).
