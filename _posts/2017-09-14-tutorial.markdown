On October 15th, a day before the start of MobiCom, I will attend two hands-on tutorials hosted at the **University of Utah** about two emerging wireless technologies: [PhantomNet](https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/phantomnet), a platform with an end-to-end mobile testbed to experiment with new wireless technologies in the wild; and [ParaDrop](http://www.paradrop.org/), a new **edge computing platform** that allows experimenters to deploy edge services in a WiFi Access Point.
