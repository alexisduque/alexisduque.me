From October 3th to 7th, I attended the prestigious [ACM Mobicom](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2016/) that has been held in New York.

On October 3th, I presented the paper "Unleashing the Power of LED-to-Camera Communications for IoT Devices", co-authored with Razvan Stanica, Herv√© Rivano and Adrien Desportes at the [VLCS 2016 workshop](http://dartnets.cs.dartmouth.edu/VLCS2016/).

[The paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2981555) is now available in the VLCS'16 workshop proceedings.
