From October 28 to 31, I attended the [Linux Foundation Open Source Summit and Embedded Linux Conference Europe](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/).

During this software developer events, I gave a quick talk about [Lilliput-AE](https://paclido.fr/lilliput-ae/), a lightweight cryptographic block cipher that is a result of the collaborative research project [PACLIDO](https://paclido.fr).
