From October 16th to 21th, I attended the [ACM Mobicom conference](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2017/) that has been held in the Snowbird Ski resort, Utah.

On October 16th, I presented the paper *SeedLight: Hardening LED-to-Camera Communication with Random Linear Coding* co-authored with Razvan Stanica, Herv√© Rivano and Adrien Desportes at the [VLCS 2017 workshop](http://vlcs17.winlab.rutgers.edu/).

[The paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3117814) is now available in the VLCS'17 workshop proceedings.
