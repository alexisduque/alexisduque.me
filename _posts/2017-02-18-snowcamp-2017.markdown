From February 15 to 18, I attended the Snowcamp 2017 in Grenoble, France.
During this software developer conference I gave an advanced talk about [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://speakerdeck.com/alexisduque/bluetooth-low-energy-vous-saurez-tout)
 and a brief popularization talk about [Visible Light Communication](https://speakerdeck.com/alexisduque/visible-light-communications-pour-liot).
