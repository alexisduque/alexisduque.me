The paper "Decoding Methods in LED-to-Smartphone Bidirectional Communication for the IoT", co-authored with Razvan Stanica, Herv√© Rivano and Adrien Desportes, has been accepted for publication at the [IEEE Global Lificongress](http://www.lificongress.com/), to be held in Paris, France, on February 8-9.

During the 2 days conference, I will introduce our work by presenting a poster.

The poster abstract will be included in the conference proceedings that will be published soon or can alternatively be accessed via the [HAL library](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01683629).
