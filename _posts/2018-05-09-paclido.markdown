Since the beginning of the year, I am involved with Rtone in the FUI23 PACLIDO project.

PACLIDO is a collaborative project that aims to develop lightweight cryptographic algorithms and protocols for the Internet of Thing.

The other partners are Airbus Cybersecurity, LORIA-CNRS, Sophia Conseil, CEA, Universit√© de Limoges and Trusted Object.

Rtone is leading 2 work packages: the use cases and demonstrations definition, and the project dissemination.

You can found more information about the project and news on its website [paclido.fr](https://paclido.fr)
