The paper "Performance Evaluation of LED-to-Camera Communication", co-authored with Razvan Stanica, Herv√© Rivano and Adrien Desportes, has been accepted for publication at the [ACM MSWiM](http://mswimconf.com/2019/), to be held in Miami Beach, Florida, USA on November 25-29.

During the conference, I introduced our work on the modeling and simulation of LED-to-Camera communication by presenting [CamComSim](https://github.com/vlc-citi-lab/camcomsim).
