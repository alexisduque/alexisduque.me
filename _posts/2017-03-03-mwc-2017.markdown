From February 26 to March 3th, I have been lucky to attend the [Mobile World Congress](https://www.mobileworldcongress.com) that takes place each year in Barcelona. This is the worldâ€™s largest event for the mobile industry, organised by the GSMA, where the leading companies (Huawei, Qualcomm, Orange, Vodafone, ...) unveil their latest innovations and strategies.

During this edition, examples of *hot* and actively discussed topics were mobile-IoT, 5G, Virtual/Augmented Reality or Artificial Intelligence. Visible Light Communications was no exception: PureLifi demonstrated its new Lifi-X dongle while Philips Lightning introduced a VLC based indoor localization system for the retail industry.
