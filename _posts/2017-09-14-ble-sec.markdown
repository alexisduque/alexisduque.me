### About IoT security

Since the Internet of Things is still in the emerging phase, ensuring security
and privacy is an important issue that must be addressed and resolved **now**.

The number of IoT and connected objects grows exponentially, so their **security
exploits** will have **more and more repercussions**, making them very
**attractive for the hackers**. Recent news and the growing IoT track at
security conferences such as [Blackhat](https://www.blackhat.com/), or
[Defcon](https://www.defcon.org/) perfectly illustrates this phenomenon.

### About Bluetooth

In regards to Bluetooth, the SIG greatly enhanced the BLE security releasing at
the end of 2014 the **Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2.** This update introduces
*LE Secure Connections* pairing model with the numeric comparison method and
the *Elliptical Curve Hellman-Diffie* (ECDH) algorithm for the key exchange.
<br> *LE Secure Connections* fixes BLE 4.0–1 exploits unveiled in 2012 by Mike
Ryan at[ TOORCON](https://toorcon.net/)
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4POOiVrdnX8), [crackle
project](http://lacklustre.net/projects/crackle/)).

Like *LE Legacy* pairing, *LE Secure Connection* defines several modes and
levels of security (see section 5.2.4 Association Models of the Bluetooth Core
Specification 4.2). Nonetheless, the available modes depend on the “IO
Capabilities” — keyboard, display, button — that the pairing devices have.

The highest level of security, *Numeric Comparison* requires that both BLE
devices have a keyboard and a display to confirm and compare a number displayed
on both the peripheral and smartphone. An alternative and more convenient
approach is using NFC.<br> By placing a smartphone close to the BLE (and NFC)
peripheral, NFC will automatically initiate the BLE pairing and keys exchange
mechanisms to establish an authenticated and encrypted communication channel.

However, the highly **limited bill of material (BOM) cost** or the **PCB size** prevents placing a screen, an interactive input, or an NFC antenna on such
devices.<br> As a consequence, they provide a weak level of security whereas the
attacks targeting such smart objects are rising.

To overcome this issue, we propose a technological **solution based on Visible Light Communication (VLC)** solution to assist the pairing and the secure
connection setup between a BLE 4.2 peripheral and a smartphone.<br> This
solution targets low-cost and size-constrained IoT devices that need to setup
the *Secure Connection* with *Numeric Comparison* to provide **a high level of security even on BLE devices that have neither input and display nor NFC**.

### Few words about Kiwink and VLC

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8pvCtdZwxeVch5MOBtPt9A.png)

[Rtone](http://rtone.fr/) has recently developed
[Kiwink](http://kwink.io/)®, a short range **bidirectional Visible Light Communication** system between an **unmodified smartphone** and a basic and **cheap LED**.<br> **Kiwink®** uses the **camera** and the **flashlight** of an
Android or iOS smartphone and does **not need hardware modification in the IoT peripheral** since it works with any micro-controller.

> **In fact, bringing Visible Light Communication to your nRF52 BLE
> device just need a firmware update!**

The communication range of such technology is tens of centimeters while the
throughput is **about 1kbps from the peripheral LED to the smartphone** and **50bps from the smartphone to the peripheral LED**.

**Kiwink®** is a trademark and its technology patented.

### Improving BLE security with Kiwink and VLC

To solve the problem described above, we propose to take advantage of this
VLC-based technology and ubiquitous LEDs, to provide **a safe side channel** to
acknowledge or display a confirmation code and establish a BLE Secure
Connection. We can also envisage to transmit a larger key if another Secure
Connection mechanism is used.

This out of band key exchange is thus **safer than NFC against passive
eavesdropper** since the light signal is highly directive and easy to obfuscate.

#### In practice, the connection establishment should work as follow:

1.  The smartphone starts sending a BLE Secure Connection request to the peripheral
1.  The smartphone and the peripheral proceeds to the Secure Connection
Establishment with Numeric Comparison according to the BLE 4.2 standard
1.  While the smartphone confirmation number appears on the smartphone screen, the
peripheral LED starts lightning and transmits its number.
1.  By placing its smartphone above its screen, the application decodes the signal
and displays the peripheral number on the smartphone screen.
1.  The user confirms that both codes are equal.
1.  The smartphone sends the acknowledgment to the peripheral using the flashlight.
1.  The peripheral decodes the acknowledgment signal and the secure connection
establishment can proceed according to the BLE 4.2 standard.

### Conclusion

We have shown that Kiwink and VLC offer the possibility to setup a *SecureConnection* with *Numeric Comparison* or *Out-Off-Band authentication* on
low-cost and size-constrained IoT devices that **have neither input and display nor NFC.**

> **Our solution brings a high level of security on BLE devices that would have
> been completely unsafe otherwise. The costs of this major improvement are negligible since Kiwink only relies on a cheap LED and a piece of software**.

Besides, many application fields and use cases of VLC exists like access
control, device-to-device communication, or accurate indoor localization using
ceiling LEDs ([Kiwink website](http://kiwink.io/) gives further information
about VLC).

Finally, feel free to give your feedback about that. We are are waiting for your
comments and suggestions!
