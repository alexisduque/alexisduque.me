From September 3 to 7, I attended for the second time the [Summer School on Security & Correctness in the Internet of Things 2018](https://www.securityweek.at/school/) organized by [IAIK](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/content/about_iaik/), in Graz, Austria.

This year, the school was collocated with the [IoT Security Week](https://www.securityweek.at).

Top level speakers in the field of security gave presentations about software/hardware attacks and countermeasures: binary exploitation, code reuses/injection, hardware side channels, cache covert channels, formal analysis, lightweight cryptography (LWC), etc.
