From Mai 8 to 12, I attended the [1st IACR Cryptology School on Security & Correctness in the Internet of Things](https://springschool.iaik.tugraz.at/) organized by [IAIK](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/content/about_iaik/), in Graz, Austria.

Top level speakers in the field of security gave presentations about software/hardware attacks and countermeasures: binary exploitation, code reuses/injection, hardware side channels, cache covert channels, formal analysis, lightweight cryptography (LWC), etc.
