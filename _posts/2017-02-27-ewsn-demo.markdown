On February 21th, I presented our *Off-the-shelf Bi-directional Visible Light Communication Module for IoT Devices and Smartphones* during the posters and demos session at [EWSN](http://www.ewsn2017.org/) that has been held in Uppsala, Sweden.

The demo abstract will be included in the conference proceedings that will be published soon or can alternatively be accessed via the [HAL library](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01473706).
