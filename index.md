<h2>About Me</h2>

Welcome to my webpage !

I am director of research and lead the security activities at [Rtone](http://www.rtone.fr).

I have a Master of Engineering degree in Telecommunications from INSA Lyon (2015) and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Lyon (2018) after a thesis in computer science on Visible Light Communications for the IoT.

My thesis was in collaboration between Rtone and the [CITI laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr) under the CIFRE fellowship, and was supervised by [Razvan Stanica](http://perso.citi.insa-lyon.fr/rstanica/), [Herv√© Rivano](http://perso.citi.insa-lyon.fr/hrivano/) and Adrien Desportes (Rtone Chief Executive Officer).

I am actively involved in the [PACLIDO](https://paclido.fr) collaborative project on lightweight cryptographic protocols for the IoT, for which I am the technical lead for Rtone.

I regularly attend IT conferences and give talks about our work on IoT.
